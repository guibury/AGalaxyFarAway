**A Galaxy Far Away - Movies Guide**

Ir order to learn about API, I've started this simple app that intend to be a guide for Star Wars movies.
I've used among others Retrofit 2, RecyclerView, CollapsingToolbar, <a href="https://github.com/bumptech/glide">Glide</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aurelhubert/ahbottomnavigation">BottomNavigation</a>. 

This project is for my studies and don't intend to infringe any copyright.
